# Multi-Showdown by 2018Lebronp01

Mutli-Showdown is a web-based showdown game that has characters from Pokémon, DnD, and  YuGiOh universes go up against one another in statistically fair combat. You are able to create your own deck of characters to fight bots. The site normalizes each character's stats for turn-based battles with type advantages, and displays everything dynamically.
